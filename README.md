Flask Playwright Test Automation
This project is a combination of knowledge in test automation, as well as self-study of python, combined together to create a flask application that can be used for web and API testing.

Installation and Usage
To install and use flask-playwright follow these steps:

Clone the repository
Install the requirements.txt: pip install -r requirements.txt
Since this project is still locally run, run on different terminals these commands:
Flask server (./app): python -m flask run --debugger
Pytest-playwright tests (./test-automation): python -m pytest -v
Endpoints
The app contains several endpoints that can be used for CRUD operations on a People model, as well as a form to perform UI tests.

Test Automation
The test automation module contains an implementation created as a modular approach that helps maintain the code and keeps it simple.

Future Plans
In the future, I plan on implementing other features such as React, CI/CD integration, and whatever will suit this project, so I'll be happy to accept suggestions and improvement ideas.

Thank you! :)
